# Assessment for planning first app attempt
This is our first attempt at making an app for recording evidence of the achivement of national curriculum assessment levels in junior school classrooms. 
This will help inform next step planning. Assign statements and build up a picture of a pupils current attainment and gaps. Once you know your gaps you can plan for progress.

We will give it a go in the Rails framework for Ruby and see where it takes us!
