# Assessment for planning first app attempt
This is our first attempt at making an app for recording evidence of the achivement of national curriculum assessment levels in junior school classrooms. 
This will help inform next step planning. Assign statements and build up a picture of a pupils current attainment and gaps. Once you know your gaps you can plan for progress.

We will give it a go in the Rails framework for Ruby and see where it takes us!

# What is assessment?
Assessment is the ongoing process of gathering, analysing and reflecting on evidence to make informed and consistent judgements to improve future student learning. 

VELS advocates 3 types of assessment /n 
	formative
	summative 
	authentic
In classrooms where assessment for learning is practiced, students are encouraged to be more active in their learning and associated assessment. The ultimate purpose of assessment for learning is to create self-regulated learners who can leave school able and confident to continue learning throughout their lives. Teachers need to know at the outset of a unit of study where their students are in terms of their learning and then continually check on how they are progressing through strengthening the feedback they get from their learners. Students are guided on what they are expected to learn and what quality work looks like. The teacher will work with the student to understand and identify any gaps or misconceptions (initial/diagnostic assessment). As the unit progresses, the teacher and student work together to assess the studentâ€™s knowledge, what she or he needs to learn to improve and extend this knowledge, and how the student can best get to that point (formative assessment). Assessment for learning occurs at all stages of the learning process.
